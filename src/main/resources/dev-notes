1) Create Service Registry application with below dependency

	 a) EurekaServer (spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server)
	 b) web-starter
	 c) devtools	

2) Configure @EnableEurekaServer annotation in boot start class


3) Configure below properties in application.yml file

	server:
	  port: 8761
	  
	eureka:
	  client:
	    register-with-eureka: false
	 
	 
Note: If Service-Registry project port is 8761 then clients can discover service-registry and will register 
automatically with service-registry. 
If service-registry project running on any other port number then we have to register clients with 
service-registry manually.
